abstract="We introduce a computer program for the dynamic and flexible management of conserved subdivided populations. Using molecular marker data or pedigree information, the software determines the optimal contributions (i.e., number of offspring) of each individual, the number of migrants, and the particular subpopulations involved in the exchange of individuals in order to maintain the largest level of gene diversity in the whole population with a desired control in the rate of inbreeding. Restrictions can be introduced for the total number of migrants, and the mating of particular pairs and their contribution. A full genetic diversity analysis of the population is carried out. The optimal contribution from each subpopulation to a pool of maximal gene diversity is also provided by the program.",
