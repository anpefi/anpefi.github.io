	abstract = {Speciation mechanisms in marine organisms have attracted great interest because of the apparent lack of substantial barriers to genetic exchange in marine ecosystems. Marine mussels of the Mytilus edulis species complex provide a good model to study mechanisms underlying species formation. They hybridise extensively at many localities and both pre- and postzygotic isolating mechanisms may be operating. Mussels have external fertilisation and sperm cells should show specific adaptations for survival and successful fertilisation. Sperm thus represent key targets in investigations of the molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation. We undertook a deep transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of mature male gonads and a 2DE/MS-based proteome analysis of sperm from Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis raised in a common environment. We provide evidence of extensive expression differences between the two mussel species, and general agreement between the transcriptomic and proteomic results in the direction of expression differences between species. Differential expression is marked for mitochondrial genes and for those involved in spermatogenesis, sperm motility, sperm-egg interactions, the acrosome reaction, sperm capacitation, ATP reserves and ROS production. Proteins and their corresponding genes might thus be good targets in further genomic analysis of reproductive barriers between these closely related species. Significance Model systems for the study of fertilization include marine invertebrates with external fertilisation, such as abalones, sea urchins and mussels, because of the ease with which large quantities of gametes released into seawater can be collected after induced spawning. Unlike abalones and sea urchins, hybridisation has been reported between mussels of different Mytilus spp., which thus makes them very appealing for the study of reproductive isolation at both pre- and post-zygotic levels. There is a lack of empirical proteomic studies on sperm samples comparing different Mytilus species, which could help to advance this study. A comparative analysis of sperm proteomes across different taxa may provide important insights into the fundamental molecular processes and mechanisms involved in reproductive isolation. It might also contribute to a better understanding of sperm function and of the adaptive evolution of sperm proteins in different taxa. There is now growing evidence from genomics studies that multiple protein complexes and many individual proteins might have important functions in sperm biology and the fertilisation process. From an applied perspective, the identification of sperm-specific proteins could also contribute to the improved understanding of fertility problems and as targets for fertility control.},
