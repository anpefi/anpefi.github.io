(2019). Optimal management of genetic diversity in subdivided populations. Frontiers in Genetics, 10:843.\nThe objective in this study is to examine the consequences of choosing a conservation strategy based on maximizing either heterozygosity or allelic diversity of SNP haplotypes in a subdivided population. This kind of study was already done for a single, undivided population (Fernández et al. 2004) resulting that each maximization method was, as would be expected, more efficient in maintaining each corresponding diversity measure. However, maximization of heterozygosity was able to maintain levels of allelic diversity almost as high as the method specifically devoted to that task. Those results were carried out in the context of a single undivided population.But most populations in nature and in conservation programs (zoos, germplasm collections, botanic gardens, etc.) are subdivided and this subdivision could have a big impact on how these optimization methods work.\nHere, we address this issue by performing simulations of a subdivided population and a conservation program where maximization of heterozygosity and allelic diversity are carried out for two sets of genetic markers, one representing a small number of known loci where diversity should be preserved and another aimed to perform whole-genome management. The pipeline required to simulate all populations assayed as well as to run the corresponding population analyses and managementsimulations is available in https://gitlab.com/elcortegano/hadopt.\nOur results suggest that maximization of allelic diversity can be more efficient in maintaining the genetic diversity of subdivided populations than maximization of expected heterozygosity because the former maintains a larger number of alleles while making a better control of inbreeding. Thus, maximization of allelic diversity should be a recommended strategy in conservation programs for structured populations.\nThis is a quite old work that a student, Adriana Labrador, started as a master thesis that I have co-directed in 2012 (science is sometimes very slow.) That preliminary work was later continued by another student, Ramón Pouso, in his undergraduate thesis, which I also co-directed, in 2014. The results were interesting but there was still a lot of work to do to to obtain solid conclusions, but just then I left Armando Caballero\u0026rsquo;s lab and my time for this type of collateral projects decreased drastically.

Genetic diversity is generally assessed by means of neutral molecular markers, and it is usually quantified by the expected heterozygosity under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the number of alleles per locus, or allelic diversity. These two measures of genetic diversity are complementary because, whereas the former is directly related to genetic variance for quantitative traits and, therefore, to the short-term response to selection and adaptation, the latter is more sensitive to population bottlenecks and relates more strongly to the long-term capacity of adaptation of populations. In the context of structured populations undergoing conservation programs, it is important to decide the optimum management strategy in order to preserve as much genetic diversity as possible, while avoiding inbreeding. Here we examine, through computer simulations, the consequences of choosing a conservation strategy based on maximizing either heterozygosity or allelic diversity of SNP haplotypes in a subdivided population. Our results suggest that maximization of allelic diversity can be more efficient in maintaining the genetic diversity of subdivided populations than maximization of expected heterozygosity, because the former maintains a larger number of alleles while making a better control of inbreeding.

We provide evidence of extensive expression differences between the two mussel species, and general agreement between the transcriptomic and proteomic results in the direction of expression differences between species. Differential expression is marked for mitochondrial genes and for those involved in spermatogenesis, sperm motility, sperm-egg interactions, the acrosome reaction, sperm capacitation, ATP reserves and ROS production.

Environmentally induced epigenetic mechanisms directly regulate gene expression and potentially lead to long-lasting effects. How phenotypic, epigenetic, and genetic components of wild populations relate to each other is, however, still largely debated. We examined the effect of broad coastline topography (as bay versus open coast) on the morphological, genetic, and epigenetic (i.e., DNA methylation) traits of the brown mussel *Perna perna* from four natural populations along the south coast of South Africa (between 33.9 S, 25.7 E and 34.2 S, 22.1 E) collected in April 2014. Several morphometric measurements were taken on the mussel body and byssal thread. The epigenetic and genetic structure of *P. perna* was assessed using the methylation sensitive analysis of polymorphisms technique. Morphological traits differed among populations, but no clear effect of topography on both morphology and genetics was found. Bay and Open Coast sites differed in the patterns of DNA methylation of selected loci, suggesting that topography shaped the epigenetic profile of populations of P. perna. The environmentally induced changes in the DNA methylation of selected loci were neither correlated with the morphological traits analysed, nor explained by the underlying genetic variance among populations. The relationship amongst epigenetics, morphology, and genetics of *P. perna* populations was shown to be complex and dynamic. Although inconsistent, the topographically linked variability in epigenetic and the phenotypic differences in genetically close populations of mussels highlights the potential role of the local environment in driving mesoscale differences among populations.","tags":null,"title":"Morphological and epigenetic variation in mussels from contrasting environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve changed the website design.\nFor the last 2 years this site was relying on the Jekyll framework using the Minimal Mistakes template.

I was curious about how it would work and to pass this website to that system would allow me to practice.

It also induces associative overdominance at neutral sites but rarely causes increased neutral genetic diversity in equilibrium populations. After a reduction in population size, linkage can cause some delay both for the expression of the inbreeding load and the corresponding purging. However, reasonable predictions can be obtained for the evolution of fitness under inbreeding and purging by using empirical estimates of the inbreeding depression rate. Purging selection against homozygotes for deleterious alleles affects the population’s pedigree. Furthermore, it can slow the loss of genetic diversity compared to that expected from the variance of gametic contributions to the breeding group and even from pedigree inbreeding.

Conservation programmes, aimed at preserving this variation, usually rely on neutral markers rather than on quantitative traits for making decisions on management. Here, we address, both through simulation analyses and experimental studies with Drosophila melanogaster, the question of whether allelic diversity for neutral markers is a better indicator of a high adaptive potential than expected heterozygosity. In both experimental and simulation studies, we established synthetic populations for which either heterozygosity or allelic diversity was maximized using information from QTL (simulations) or unlinked neutral markers (simulations and experiment).

Genetic divergence and diversity are the two foundations by which priorities for conservation are typically determined. However, these measures may be confounded when past bottlenecks reduce genetic diversity of populations but also lead to their divergence. This study examines the potential conflicts in population prioritization for a relictual Japanese endemic conifer, Sciadopitys verticillata using nuclear microsatellites. High genetic structuring at the nuclear level compared to many other conifers (Fst = 0.129) was observed across the species range along with significant differences in genetic diversity between southern and northern populations. Conflict among genetic diversity and divergence population prioritization methods was observed in populations at the southwestern range edge of Kyushu and Chugoku, which were the most genetically distinct but also harboured the lowest diversity (Kyushu, He = 0.288, Ar = 2.172, and Chugoku, He = 0.222, Ar = 2.010). These populations contained only a subset of the genetic diversity found in Central Honshu and the Kii Peninsula (Central Honshu, He = 0.347, Ar = 2.707 and the Kii Peninsula, He = 0.337, Ar = 2.683), suggesting a reduction in genetic diversity as a result of bottlenecks. To determine if these highly bottlenecked populations in southwestern Japan are on the trajectory to extinction, or, conversely, if they harbour important genetic variation that has been fixed at the southwestern edge of the species range, common garden experiments are recommended in the future.","tags":null,"title":"Conflict in outcomes for conservation based on population genetic diversity and genetic divergence approaches: a case study in the Japanese relictual conifer *Sciadopitys verticillata* (Sciadopityaceae)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ávila, V.","**Pérez-Figueroa, A.**","Caballero, A.","Hill, W.

However, the mechanisms underlying the development of the migrant morphotype are still unclear. At one point parr–smolt transformation is initiated and, as a result, juvenile trout are ready to leave the river and migrate to the sea. The smoltification process has been linked to various factors such as body size, growth rate and the physiological state of the fish. In addition, the process is also strongly influenced by environmental factors such as year, seasonality, water temperature and flow rate. For example, hatchery environment can depress the natural parr–smolt transformation and consequently, the success of the seawater migration of reared trout from these hatchery programmes might be adversely affected. We have investigated whether changes in DNA methylation, by means of MSAP (methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism), could be involved in anadromy. We identified dramatic differences in genome-wide methylation patterns between hatchery reared and seawater brown trout. Furthermore, we demonstrated that salt enriched diets can trigger short-term genome-wide methylation changes in hatchery reared trout. However, these changes only lasted for a short period of time. Determining the duration of this effect could result in increased survival of hatchery-reared trout in seawater when fed on salt-enriched diets. Altogether, these results suggest that salt-induced alterations in DNA methylation patterns could play an important role in enabling fish acclimation to seawater conditions, potentially with important economic consequences for fish farming.","tags":["MSAP","methylation","fish"],"title":"Environmental induced methylation changes associated with seawater adaptation in brown trout.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Pérez-Figueroa, A.**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1357862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1357862400,"objectID":"c12c9988748f47254e4ed1157e4631df","permalink":"http://anpefi.eu/publication/2013.apf.msap/","publishdate":"2013-01-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013.apf.msap/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study msap, an R package which analyses methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP or MS-AFLP) data is presented.

However for loci with 20 alleles, only 83% of allelic diversity will be maintained over 200 years. Removal of only juveniles (calves and yearlings) resulted in longer generation intervals which led to higher maintenance of allelic diversity (96%) after 200 years compared to the culling of adults (94%) when the mean census size was 3250 (for loci with five alleles). These simulations suggest that fluctuations in population census size do not necessarily accelerate the loss of genetic variation, at least for the relatively large census size and growing populations such as in Yellowstone bison. They also suggest that the conservation of high allelic diversity (95%) at loci with many alleles (e.g., ⩾5) will require maintenance of a populations size greater than approximately 3250 and removal of mainly or only juveniles.","tags":null,"title":"Conserving genomic variability in large mammals: Effect of population fluctuations and variance in male reproductive success on variability in Yellowstone bison","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vilas, A.","**Pérez-Figueroa, A.**","Caballero, A."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1336003200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1336003200,"objectID":"1ce71776a410a8be3ac573250ee5ae68","permalink":"http://anpefi.eu/publication/2012.vilas/","publishdate":"2012-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012.vilas/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigated the performance of two of the most popular differentiation-based methods to detect loci under selection (dfdist/fdist and bayescan) in order to ascertain the average chromosome map distance between the detected outlier markers and the nearest loci under selection.

Both methods usually detect a population decline only one generation after it occurs if Ne drops to less than approximately 100, and 40 microsatellite loci and 50 individuals are sampled.

Power for early detection increased more rapidly with the number of individuals sampled than with the number of loci genotyped, primarily for the LD method. The number of samples available is therefore an important criterion when choosing between the LD and temporal methods.

Mean estimates of Ne, Nn, and m did not differ significantly between ecotypes, but local ecotype differences in migration between the two closest localities (larger migration rates in RB than in SU populations) could explain the pattern in population differentiation.","tags":null,"title":"Genetic Differentiation and Estimation of Effective Population Size and Migration Rates in Two Sympatric Ecotypes of the Marine Snail *Littorina saxatilis*","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Pérez-Figueroa, A.**","Cruz, F.","Carvajal-Rodríguez, A.","Rolán-Alvarez, E.","Caballero, A."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1112572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1112572800,"objectID":"930dbb7656febd87ce105f6e997f7de2","permalink":"http://anpefi.eu/publication/2005.apf.polymorp/","publishdate":"2005-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2005.apf.polymorp/","section":"publication","summary":"Two rocky shore ecotypes of Littorina saxatilis from north‐west Spain live at different shore levels and habitats and have developed an incomplete reproductive isolation through size assortative mating. The system is regarded as an example of sympatric ecological speciation. Several experiments have indicated that different evolutionary forces (migration, assortative mating and habitat‐dependent selection) play a role in maintaining the polymorphism. However, an assessment of the combined contributions of these forces supporting the observed pattern in the wild is absent. A model selection procedure using computer simulations was used to investigate the contribution of the different evolutionary forces towards the maintenance of the polymorphism. The agreement between alternative models and experimental estimates for a number of parameters was quantified by a least square method. The results of the analysis show that the fittest evolutionary model for the observed polymorphism is characterized by a high gene flow, intermediate‐high reproductive isolation between ecotypes, and a moderate to strong selection against the nonresident ecotypes on each shore level. In addition, a substantial number of additive loci contributing to the selected trait and a narrow hybrid definition with respect to the phenotype are scenarios that better explain the polymorphism, whereas the ecotype fitnesses at the mid‐shore, the level of phenotypic plasticity, and environmental effects are not key parameters.","tags":null,"title":"The evolutionary forces maintaining a wild polymorphism of *Littorina saxatilis*: model selection by computer simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodríguez-Ramilo, S.T.","**Pérez-Figueroa, A.**","Fernández, B.","Fernández, J.","Caballero, A."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1076976000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1076976000,"objectID":"c625afe350ea971a09b65a3ccf7f63b1","permalink":"http://anpefi.eu/publication/2004.rodriguez-ramilo/","publishdate":"2004-02-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2004.rodriguez-ramilo/","section":"publication","summary":"We carried out an experiment of inbreeding and upward artificial selection for egg‐to‐adult viability in a recently captured population of Drosophila melanogaster, as well as computer simulations of the experimental design, in order to obtain information on the nature of genetic variation for this important fitness component. The inbreeding depression was linear with a rate of 0.70 ± 0.11% of the initial mean per 1% increase in inbreeding coefficient, and the realized heritability was 0.06 ± 0.07. We compared the empirical observations of inbreeding depression and selection response with computer simulations assuming a balance between the occurrence of partially recessive deleterious mutations and their elimination by selection. Our results suggest that a model assuming mutation‐selection balance with realistic mutational parameters can explain the genetic variation for viability in the natural population studied. Several mutational models are incompatible with some observations and can be discarded. Mutational models assuming a low rate of mutations of large average effect and highly recessive gene action, and others assuming a high rate of mutations of small average effect and close to additive gene action, are compatible with all the observations.","tags":null,"title":"Mutation‐selection balance accounting for genetic variation for viability in *Drosophila melanogaster* as deduced from an inbreeding and artificial selection experiment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernández, J.","Rodríguez-Ramilo, S.T.","**Pérez-Figueroa, A.**","Lopez-Fanjul, C.","Caballero, A."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1052438400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1052438400,"objectID":"b40d43bf02fd2cb2c1f59d2160279172","permalink":"http://anpefi.eu/publication/2003.fernandez/","publishdate":"2003-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2003.fernandez/","section":"publication","summary":"Fecundity is usually considered as a trait closely connected to fitness and is expected to exhibit substantial nonadditive genetic variation and inbreeding depression. However, two independent experiments, using populations of different geographical origin, indicate that early fecundity inDrosophila melanogaster behaves as a typical additive trait of low heritability. The first experiment involved artificial selection in inbred and non‐inbred lines, all of them started from a common base population previously maintained in the laboratory for about 35 generations. The realized heritability estimate was 0.151 ± 0.075 and the inbreeding depression was very small and nonsignificant (0.09 ± 0.09% of the non‐inbred mean per 1% increase in inbreeding coefficient). With inbreeding, the observed decrease in the within‐line additive genetic variance and the corresponding increase of the between‐line variance were very close to their expected values for pure additive gene action. This result is at odds with previous studies showing inbreeding depression and, therefore, directional dominance for the same trait and species. All experiments, however, used laboratory populations, and it is possible that the original genetic architecture of the trait in nature was subsequently altered by the joint action of random drift and adaptation to captivity. Thus, we carried out a second experiment, involving inbreeding without artificial selection in a population recently collected from the wild. In this case we obtained, again, a maximum‐likelihood heritability estimate of 0.210 ± 0.027 and very little nonsignificant inbreeding depression (0.06 ± 0.12%). The results suggest that, for fitness‐component traits, low levels of additive genetic variance are not necessarily associated with large inbreeding depression or high levels of nonadditive genetic variance.","tags":null,"title":"Lack of nonadditive genetic effects on early fecundity in *Drosophila melanogaster*","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Pérez-Figueroa, A.**","Rodríguez-Ramilo, S.T.","Fernández, J.","Caballero, A."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1029715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1029715200,"objectID":"ba3c06913e598e9e4518c164ed2605f2","permalink":"http://anpefi.eu/publication/2002.proc.apf/","publishdate":"2002-08-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2002.proc.apf/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Inferences on the nature of genetic variation for viability from artificial selection and inbreeding in *Drosophila*.","type":"publication"}]
